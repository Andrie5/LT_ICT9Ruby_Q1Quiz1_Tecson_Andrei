	<h1> How to Train Your Dragon </h1> <br>	
	<p> This was one of the best animated movies made for kids. The story, characters, and plot were well thought out and amazing despite the fact that it was a children's movie. I would always use to watch this movie on repeat when I was younger and it still has a special place for me today. </p>
